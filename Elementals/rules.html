        ELEMENTALS IS A STRATEGICAL PLAYER VS PLAYER GAME<br><br><br>

        1. EACH PLAYER CHOOSES THEIR ELEMENTAL ATTRIBUTE WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN PASSIVE <br><br>
        &bullet; Fire: High DMG with No Heal Skill (Passive - Burning Soul: Deals extra DMG equal to 10%-20% of lost HP) <br><br>
        &bullet; Water: Decent Heal with Mid DMG (Passive - Sea Cradle: Heal effectiveness will increase as HP drops) <br><br>
        &bullet; Earth: Massive Heal with Low DMG (Passive - Magnitude: Deals 10-15 additional DMG every skill as HP drops) <br><br>
        &bullet; Wind: Well balanced all rounder (Passive - Windtalker: Heals 15% of current HP every successful move) <br><br>

        <br>
        2. EACH ELEMENT HAVE 3 DIFFERENT SKILLS (1 BASIC AND 2 SPECIAL) WITH 2 DIFFERENT EFFECTS (HEAL AND DAMAGE) <br><br><br>
        3. EACH ATTACK WILL GO THROUGH A RANDOMIZER TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE OR NOT (<b>EACH MOVE HAS AN 80% CHANCE OF WORKING</b>)<br><br><br>
        4. PLAYERS HAVE <b>LIMITED MANA</b> TO PREVENT SPAMMING (<b>BASIC ATTACKS REPLENISH 10 MANA PER MOVE</b>) <br><br><br>
        5. EACH PLAYER WILL TAKE TURNS EXECUTING THEIR MOVES UNTIL ONE PLAYER'S HP DROPS TO 0 OR BELOW 0<br><br><br>

        <br><br>
        <b class="heading">TIPS AND TRICKS:</b> <br><br>
        1. ELEMENTALS IS COMPLETELY BASED ON YOUR STRATEGY AND LUCK  <br><br>
        &bullet; EARTH counters FIRE <br><br>
        &bullet; FIRE counters WATER <br><br>
        &bullet; WATER counters WIND <br><br>
        &bullet; WIND counters EARTH <br><br><br>

        NOTE: THESE ARE JUST BASED ON ELEMENTAL STATS (<b>THERE ARE OTHER VARIABLES THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR WINRATE</b>)
        <br><br><br>
        2. USE <b>CONSOLE</b> TO CHECK PLAYERS' LIVES AFTER EVERY ROUND <br><br><br>
        3. PLAYER 1 ALWAYS GOES FIRST (USE THIS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE)
